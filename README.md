# 2004 Yamaha AR230 Project

This is a summary of the work and troubleshooting done on a **2004 Yamaha AR230** through multiple phases, including replacing the **ECMs (Engine Control Modules)**, conducting **compression tests**, fixing various mechanical and electrical issues, and general maintenance. The project went through several stages before eventually being sold for a significant profit.

## Phase 1: Engine Diagnostics and Maintenance
### ECM Replacement and Compression Testing
Performed a compression test on both engines to diagnose any internal issues:
- **Date of Test**: 12/3/23  
  **Port Engine**  
  - Cylinder 1: **172 psi**
  - Cylinder 2: **160 psi**
  - Cylinder 3: **120 psi** (potential issue)
  - Cylinder 4: **162 psi**  
  **Starboard Engine**  
  - Cylinder 1: **162 psi**
  - Cylinder 2: **170 psi**
  - Cylinder 3: **131 psi** (potential issue)
  - Cylinder 4: **155 psi**

### Oil Change and Filter Replacement
Conducted two oil changes: a full complete oil change and a partial change for both engines.
- Used approximately **6 liters of Yamalube 10W40** for the partial change, and slightly less than **4 liters** for the complete oil change.

**Starboard Engine Oil Levels**:
- **First fill**: Oil level was between **F** (Full) and **E** (Empty).
- **After 10s crank**: Oil level was approximately **1/3** above **E**.
- **After running & second fill**: Oil level directly on **L** (Low) after another run and fill.

**Port Engine Oil Levels**:
- **First fill**: Oil was just between **F** and the line above it.
- **After first crank**: Slightly below halfway above **F** and next line.
- **After running & second fill**: Oil level directly on **L** line after running and filling again.

### Spark Plug Issues
The engine had trouble building RPMs, possibly due to spark plug issues. This issue would be addressed in the next phases.

## Phase 2: Deck and Cosmetic Fixes
- Cleaned oil spills on the deck.
- Addressed **chips in the gelcoat**.
- Tightened the **tongue driver seat screws**.

## Phase 3: Cleaning, Wiring, and Tower Work
- **Engine Bay Cleanup**: Cleared out the engine bay and removed spray paint from the floor.
- **Tower Work**: Removed and remounted the wake tower; planned to replace bolts.
- **Power Washing & Greasing**: Power washed the boat and greased bearings.
- **Mildew Removal**: Cleaned any mildew present on the boat.

### Materials & Tools to Buy
- **Ratchet Straps**, **Microfiber Cloths**
- **Wake Tower Bolts**, **Driver Seat Screws**
- **Oil Filters**, **Pump Extension Cord**

## Costs Overview
- **Home Depot Supplies**: $53
- **Boat Registration**: $55
- **Shipping Costs**: $42 total
- **ECU Testing**: $107
- **ECU Repair**: $382
- **Oil, Filters, Pump**: $95
- **Storage**: $106 x 2 months
- **Amazon Purchases**: $50
- **Boat Purchase**: $11,000
- **Gas for Transport (ATL to Northport)**: $130
- **Boat Numbers**: $21
- **Additional Oil**: $50

## Electrical Work and Diagnosis
### Amp & Speaker Configuration
- Found back two speakers not working; both subs on **channel 6**.
- Driver component on **channel 5**; nothing on channels **1/2**.
- Front right speaker on **channel 3/4**; passenger component also on **channel 3/4**.

### Battery and Voltage Issues
- All batteries read at **12V**.
- Voltage drop to **8V** at switches; **13V** when jump starter is on.
- All switches powering lights draw **13V** with jump starter but fail to turn on the stereo.
- Suspected short circuit at the sub or an improper connection to the amp, as remote wire from head unit does not connect anywhere.
- Power drops to stereo when ignition is on, indicating possible lack of amps.

### Injector Diagnosis (10/1/23)
**Port Engine**: Injectors **3** and **4** were spraying. After swapping injectors **2** and **3**, injectors **3** and **4** continued to spray.
**Starboard Engine**: No injectors were spraying upon cranking.

## Update as of 7/28/2024
After extensive work, the **ECUs were repaired** and all major issues were resolved. The main source of electrical problems was identified as a **bad ground connection**, which was corrected. The rest of the electrical and mechanical issues were cleaned up, and the boat was sold for a profit of well over **$10,000**.

### Final Notes
This project required significant time diagnosing mechanical and electrical issues, repairing critical components like the ECUs, and performing general maintenance. Through careful troubleshooting and hands-on repairs, the project was a **great success** and provided valuable experience in boat restoration and maintenance.
