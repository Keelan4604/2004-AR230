things wrong with electrical
  all batteries at 12v
  8v to switches
  13v to switches when jump starter on
  all switches turning on lights
  13v with jump starter on doesn’t turn on stereo
  enough power to start motors easily
  short circuit at sub? amp
  no accessories turning on
  remote wires not connected properly
  remote coming out of head unit doesn’t go anywhere
  when i turn on ignition while stereo is on, stereo noticeably loses power- not enough amps? how do motors start then?

UPDATE AS OF 7/28/2024
  Just came across this post from a while ago. Got both of the ECUs fixed and working, found the source of the problem was a bad ground (as always). Cleaned up and fixed the rest of the problems and sold for a profit well over $10,000. Great success
